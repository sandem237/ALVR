"""Download the hand models the emulator draws for hand tracking emulation.

The models come from Godot XR Tools, whose glTF files declare themselves CC0 Public Domain in
their own `asset.copyright` (the surrounding project is MIT licensed). They fit this use exactly:
one skinned mesh each, rigged to twenty-six joints named after OpenXR's `XR_EXT_hand_tracking`
layout, which is the same set ALVR carries on the wire. Nothing about the emulator depends on
these particular files -- the loader matches joints by name and corrects for whatever bone
convention a rig uses -- so any rigged, skinned hand can replace them by pointing `left_model` and
`right_model` in `hands.json` somewhere else.

They are downloaded rather than vendored so this repository does not carry third-party art.

    python alvr/client_emulator/tools/fetch_hand_model.py

Writes `hand_left.gltf` and `hand_right.gltf` into `target/debug/models/` by default, which is
where `hands.json` looks for them. Pass a directory to write somewhere else.
