//! OpenXR's interaction poses, and where they sit on an emulated device.
//!
//! An application never sees a hand as 26 joints. It asks for *poses* — where to aim from, where
//! the hand grips, where a fingertip pokes — and the runtime derives those from the joints. Those
//! derivations are where this project's bugs have lived: an aim ray that came out of the middle
//! finger, an aim origin that moved when the index finger curled, a grip that sat 14 cm in front of
//! the palm. None of them are visible in the joints themselves, which is why they were each found
//! by their symptoms rather than by looking.
//!
//! So this module computes the poses as the OpenXR 1.1 specification defines them (§12.36, "Hand
//! interaction profile"), and the toolbar can draw any one of them as an axis gizmo. That makes the
//! derivation observable: if the ray leaves the wrong place, the gizmo shows it leaving the wrong
//! place, in the same frame the hand is drawn in.
//!
//! Everything here is in the **palm frame**, matching [`crate::hands::skeleton`]'s output, so
//! multiplying by the hand's world transform places a gizmo. The spec's own axis conventions are
//! quoted at each pose, because several are counter-intuitive — grip's -Z runs *across* the hand
//! from the little finger to the index, not along it.
