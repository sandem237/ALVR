//! Emulated hand tracking: the articulation model, the gesture library, and the settings file.
//!
//! ALVR carries hand tracking as the 26 joint poses of OpenXR's `XR_EXT_hand_tracking`, in world
//! space, and the server turns those into SteamVR's 31-bone skeleton itself
//! (`server_openvr::tracking::to_openvr_ffi_hand_skeleton`). So the emulator's job is to produce a
//! plausible 26-joint skeleton, and everything downstream is the real path.
//!
//! Posing those 26 joints directly would mean 26 free rotations, most combinations of which are
//! not hands. Instead a pose is seven numbers — a curl per finger, one splay for the hand, and the
//! thumb's opposition — and the joint angles follow from them; see [`HandPose`]. That is the design
//! document's parameterisation with one refinement: splay is attenuated as the fingers curl, since
//! a fist cannot fan.
//!
//! Poses are built in the **palm frame**, which is OpenXR's palm joint verbatim: the spec puts it
//! "at the center of the middle finger's metacarpal bone", with "+Z parallel to the middle
//! finger's metacarpal bone, pointing away from the finger tips" and "+Y perpendicular to palm
//! surface and pointing towards the back of the hand". So -Z runs towards the fingertips, +Y out
//! of the back of the hand, and +X completes it — pointing towards the thumb on the left hand and
//! away from it on the right. The finger joints follow the spec's own convention too (-Z along the
//! bone towards the tip, +Y out of the back of the finger nail), so the joints this produces need
//! no conversion anywhere. The middle metacarpal therefore lies exactly on the palm frame's Z
//! axis, and the wrist exactly behind it, which is what the constants below encode.
