//! Hand emulation UI: the toolbar section and the gesture panels in the bottom corners.
//!
//! The icons over the 3D view and the 6DoF movement panel are the controllers', shared through
//! [`crate::overlay`], because the design calls for the hands to be posed in exactly the same way.
//! What is specific to hands is choosing the articulation, which is what these panels do.
//!
//! Each gesture button draws the pose it selects, rendered from that gesture's own joints rather
//! than from artwork. A gesture added to `hands.json` therefore gets a correct icon with no file to
//! draw, and the icon cannot drift from what the gesture actually does.
