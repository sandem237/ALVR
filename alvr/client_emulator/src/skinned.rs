//! Skinned glTF loading, and retargeting an arbitrary hand rig onto the emulator's joints.
//!
//! The environment loader in [`crate::scene`] flattens node transforms and drops skins, which is
//! right for a static room and useless for a hand: a hand model is one mesh whose vertices follow
//! a skeleton. This loads the skin as well, so the hand can actually be posed.
//!
//! **Retargeting.** A hand rig is authored to whatever convention its artist used — the model this
//! ships against runs each bone along its own +Y, a Blender armature default, while the joints the
//! emulator produces follow OpenXR's -Z. Rather than assume any of that, both skeletons are
//! reduced to the same purely geometric frame (bone along -Z, back of the hand along +Y) by
//! [`hands::canonical_frames`], and the constant rotation between a rig's own bone frame and that
//! one is measured once from its bind pose. Posing then means applying the emulator's joint
//! rotation and that constant, so any rig whose joints can be named works, and the drawn hand
//! follows the joints being sent rather than approximating them.
